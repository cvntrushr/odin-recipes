Hello! This is my first project working with HTML and Git.

This project consists of a cooking recipe website, throughout the next
lessons I will be updating the project with CSS and Javascript to stylize it.

So far I've learned how to create basic HTML pages, about relative and 
absolute links and basic format options for the page.
