            <li>1 (10.75-oz.) frozen pund cake, thawed</li>
            <li>2 pt. vanilla ice cream, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup blueberry preserves</li>
            <li>2 pt. raspberry sorbet, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup raspberry preserves</li>
            <li>1 (10-oz.) pacakge frozen raspberries, thawed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>1 cup whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>Garnishes: assorted fresh berries, mint leaves</li>

            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut 10 (1/2-inch-thick) slices from cake. Arrange slices in a single layer on bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, trimming as needed to snugly cover pan. Save remaining cake for another use.</li>
            <li>Stir together vanilla ice cream and blueberry preserves in a medium bowl. Spread blueberry ice-cream mixture over cake slices. Cover and freeze 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Stir together softened raspberry sorbet and raspberry preserves in a medium bowl. Spread raspberry sorbet mixture over blueberry ice-cream mixture. Cover and freeze 3 hours to 2 days.            </li>
            <li>Process frozen raspberries, honey, and 2 Tbsp. water in a blender until smooth. Press raspberry mixture through a wire-mesh strainer using the back of a spoon. Discard pulp and seeds. Chill until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Just before serving, beat cream and sugar at medium speed until soft peaks form. Gently run a sharp knife around edge of cake to loosen. Remove springform pan. Spread whipped cream over frozen cake. Drizzle with raspberry-honey sauce.</li>
