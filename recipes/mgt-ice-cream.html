    <h3>Delicious and somehow healthy!</h3>
    <p>This green tea ice cream is made with real matcha powder. I created the recipe based on the sweet cream base from Ben and Jerry's.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon matcha green tea powder, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk matcha powder in a bowl to remove any lumps. Add a splash of milk and whisk until matcha powder is completely dissolved. Gradually whisk in remaining milk.</li>
            <li>Transfer matcha mixture to a pot. Add cream and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk sugar and eggs together in a bowl. Pour 1/2 cup hot matcha mixture into egg mixture, whisking quickly until thoroughly combined. Repeat with remaining matcha mixture. Pour mixture back into the pot.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir matcha mixture over medium-low heat until heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Pour chilled matcha mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.</li>
            
        </ol>
