    <h3>On keto? Don't worry, this wont break the diet</h3>
    <p>This keto ice cream is quick to make with no ice cream machine needed! After trying different variations of ingredients, I finally figured out a combination that produced a smooth and creamy texture, yet didn't freeze rock-hard like most no-churn ice cream can</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons powdered zero-calorie sweetener (such as Swerve)</li>
            <li>1 tablespook vodka</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>


            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Combine cream, sweetener, vodka, vanilla extract, xanthan gum, and salt in a wide-mouth pint-sized jar. Blend cream mixture with an immersion blender in an up-and-down motion until cream has thickened and soft peaks have formed, 60 to 75 seconds.</li>
          <li>Blend cream mixture with an immersion blender in an up-and-down motion until cream has thickened and soft peaks have formed, 60 to 75 seconds.</li>
          <li>Cover jar and place in the freezer for 3 to 4 hours, stirring every 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
          <li>Serve!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The vodka is optional, however it really helps keep the ice cream scoopable and you don't taste it!</p>
        <p>Freezing for 3 to 4 hours produces the best consistency, however if you'd like to soften it a bit, 10 seconds in the microwave does the trick, or remove from the freezer 15 minutes ahead of time.</p>
        <p>You can pulse granular sweetener in a blender or food processor to achieve a powdered consistency.</p>
        <p>Use different flavored extracts for variety.</p>
